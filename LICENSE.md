### Font Attribution
**Required**: Each font family has specific attribution requirements defined by its original license. Please refer to the individual font's `LICENSE.txt` file and `README.md` for proper attribution requirements.

### Derivative Works
Any derivative works (subsets, format conversions, etc.) stored in `_subsets/` are generated from the original fonts and must comply with the original font's license terms. Generation metadata and source attribution are preserved in the derivative files' directory structure.
